** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can.

** Voltage, Resistance and Current
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Before you can do anything to design and create new, original projects, you'll need to understand three fundamental electronic concepts. 
- *Voltage*, is the difference in energy level between two points in a circuit, which will allow electrons to move through a conductor. The more difference in energy levels there is, the larger the amount of current can be drawn, and the larger item they can power. A basic red LED might only need 2.7V to run, whereas a laptop might need 24V, and a large electric motor moving a lift might need 415V to operate. 
- **Current** is a measure of how many electrons pass a particular point in the circuit per second. Higher current (measured in Amps) means faster electron flow in the circuit. The process of moving electrons through a material generates frictional heat. If the wire used in a product is too thin, and too much current passes through it, the wire will melt! This is the principal on which fuses are made. 
- **Resistance** is a measure of to what extent a material resists the flow of current in a circuit, and is measured in Ohms. Good conductors of electricity (like copper and gold) have very low resistance (1-2 \Omega{}), and insulators (like rubber and plastic) have a high resistance (several million Ohms). 
- An excellent explanation of this can be seen over at [[https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law][SparkFun]].

- Resistors are components which are designed to provide carefully controlled amounts of resistance; ideal when designing circuits. The coloured bands on a resistor tell you what the value of the resistor is.

| Value | Colour | Mnemonic |
|-------+--------+----------|
|     0 | Black  | Bye      |

|     3 | Orange | Off      |
|     4 | Yellow | You      |

|     7 | Violet | Via      |
|     8 | Grey   | Great    |
|     9 | White  | Western  |

- Get someone to give you 4 different resistors. Read the coloured bands to see what their values are, and then use the [[https://www.bournetoinvent.com/projects/soldering_license/step_5.html][multimeter]] to confirm. 
- Choosing the correct setting to measure DC Voltage (DCV) is the same as for measuring resistance. It doesn't really make a difference, but its more "correct" to use the black (common) probe for the negative end of the battery, and the red on the right.
-  Use the multimeter to discover how many volts each of the following produces:
	- Square battery (PP3)
    - AA battery
    - AAA battery
    - CR2032
** One more thing...
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- If you connect the positive terminal of a battery directly to the negative (e.g. with a wire), the battery gets very hot. The battery rapidly looses all its charge.
- What's happening is that because there is no "load" on the circuit (no components to pass through to slow the current flow), electrons are able to fly around the battery unimpeded, as fast as they possibly can.
- The ultra-fast movement of electrons generates a lot of heat. If the power source is one designed to carry a lot of current (e.g. a car battery) and it is shorted out, this can cause the battery to spark or even explode! This is why mechanics are very careful not to drop (metal) spanners on top of car batteries. 
- Then this happens, this is called a **short circuit**, or "short".
