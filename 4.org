** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can. 
* Introduction
- Designed in 1971, the 555 timer chip is the most successful integrated circuit in the world. Its purpose is to allow circuits to utilize time (e.g. to make a light flash on and off at a certain interval). 
- It can be used as an ASTABLE timer to make flashing light circuits or to make a loudspeaker produce a sound and it can be used as a MONOSTABLE circuit to switch a device on after a set time or to switch a device on for a set time. The 555 makes it easy to get accurate time delays.

- The 555 timer is an 8 pin DIL package containing 25 transistors, 2 diodes and 16 resistors. Its legs are configured as follows :-
[[./img/555.png]]
- 1. 0v 
- 2. Trigger (start) 
- 3. Output
- 4. Reset
- 5. Control voltage
- 6. Threshold
- 7. Discharge
- 8. 4.5v-16v supply voltage

** 555 as a monostable
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
A mono stable circuit has one input and one output. When the input is made high, the output goes high. When the input goes low, the output stays high for a set time period, then goes low. Astable circuits are easily recognised, and pins 6 and 7 are connected to the positive rail. 
[[./img/mono_ex.png]]
The time the output stays high can be calculated with…

*T = 1.1 x R x C*

e.g. a 1MΩ resistor and a 220µF capacitor…

R= 1,000,000Ω
C= 0.00022F
T = 242 seconds.

_Examples_ A door lock. When the release button is pushed, the door is unlocked for 3 seconds, then the locked again to give time to open the door. 

A hand drier. When a hand triggers the sensor, the drier runs for around 30 seconds before turning off again.

** 555 as an astable
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
This circuit needs no trigger to start it. As soon as power is supplied the output will begin to oscillate between 9 volts and 0 volts. The time the output spends in each state depends on the values of R1 , R2 and C. The astable circuit can be made to oscillate very quickly (up to millions of cycles per sec) or slowly (down to many minutes per cycle). It can be used to make bulbs flash, drive a loudspeaker to produce a noise or be used as a counter/ timer.
[[./img/ast_ex.png]]
Astable circuits are easily recognised, and pins 2 and 6 are connected, and go to 0v. 
[[./img/ast_graph.png]]

*Mark time = 0.7 x (R_{1} + R_{2}) x C*

*Space time = 0.7 x R_{2} x C*

*Frequency = 1.44 / ((R_{1} + 2R_{2}) x C)*

_Examples_ A tone generator could be made to produce sounds of different pitches through a speaker.

A burglar alarm could have its sensors send a pulse to the alarm box to say its working. If the wire was cut, the lack of a pulse could be used to trigger the alarm.

A strobe bike light could be produced to keep cyclists safe at night

** Sample Questions
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- At a small lighthouse, the keeper wants to make their lights come on for a few seconds, then off for a few seconds when the power is turned on to the main light. 
	- What type of 555 circuit would be needed to achieve this?
	- A 555 timer won’t be able to deliver sufficient power to turn on and off the main light. What could be used to handle such a large current safely?
    - Make a simulation of this scenario on a breadboard, using an LED. Use a 220µF capacitor, 4.7kΩ for R1 and 10kΩ for R2. What would the mark and space values be?

- A student is designing a doorbell with a PTM switch. When the button is pushed, the buzzer should sound for at least 3 seconds, no matter how long the button is held in place. 
	- What type of 555 circuit is needed?
    - If a 220µF (0.000220F) capacitor is used, what sized resistor (to the nearest hundred) would be needed to achieve a 3s time delay?
    - Make a circuit for this setup on a breadboard.
